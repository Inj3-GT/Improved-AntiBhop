Garry's Mod / Inj3 - Improved AntiBhop

------
- Anti Bunny Hop executed on the server/client.
- The principle is simple, the player won't be able to perform several jumps simultaneously (this doesn't affect velocity), and there will be a predetermined delay between each action.
- You can modify the delay in the ipr_antibhop.lua file.
- Compatible with all gamemodes.
